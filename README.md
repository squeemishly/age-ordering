You have age data for a group of people:

```
data = [
  ['Frank', 33],
  ['Stacy', 15],
  ['Juan', 24],
  ['Dom', 32],
  ['Steve', 24],
  ['Jill', 24]
]
```

* Level 1: Write code that'll output the names (and only the names) in order by
ascending age
* Level 2: Output the name with the age, like `Juan (24)`
* Level 3: Write code to automatically build a hash with the age as the key and
an array of names as the value (all the people who are that age). e.g.
`{24 => ['Juan', 'Steve', 'Jill']...}`
